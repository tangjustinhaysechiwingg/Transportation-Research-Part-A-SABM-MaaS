## ✨ Highlights  
✔ **We developed a Spatial Agent-Based Model for Mobility-as-a-Service (SABM-MaaS).**  
✔ **Approximately 79.6% of survey respondents expressed interest in MaaS.**  
✔ **The monthly subscription plan saw the highest adoption when discounts were offered.**  
✔ **The yearly plan had the lowest adoption rate among all MaaS subscription options.**  
✔ **MaaS advertisements were most effective during the initial launch phase.**

## 📖 Abstract  
Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) has gained increasing worldwide popularity in the transport industry. However, it remains unclear how MaaS might diffuse over time and across space at the micro-scale. In response, we developed a spatial agent-based model to explore MaaS adoption and subscription (SABM-MaaS) in Beijing, China, based on empirical findings derived from questionnaire survey data collected in Beijing in January 2020.  

In particular, we designed four MaaS plans—**pay-as-you-go, monthly, seasonal (three months), and yearly subscriptions**—to analyze user adoption preferences. The results of the reference scenario revealed that:  
- The **monthly plan (with a 20% discount) was the most popular**, with nearly one-fifth of agents adopting it.  
- **Pay-as-you-go, seasonal, and yearly plans followed in adoption rates.**  
- Several **"what-if" scenarios** were tested to analyze the impact of different discount offerings, the availability of only one MaaS plan, and variations in MaaS advertisement intensity.  
- **Users consistently preferred short-term plans (monthly subscription and pay-as-you-go) over long-term commitments.**  
- **Strong initial MaaS advertisement significantly boosted early adoption but had limited long-term effects.**  

These findings provide **valuable insights** for MaaS companies, multimodal transport operators, and demand-responsive transport planners in **optimizing MaaS promotion strategies, pricing models, and service planning**.
